          <p class="paragraph">
            Our experienced education counsellors are ready to advise students on courses and career opportunities according to their educational background, interests, aptitude, and aspirations. Have a broad network with education
            providers, we can suggest a wide range of study options and programs to meet the students' needs. Smart Education is an all-round service provider. Our care and concern continue though the students have left their home country.
            Our Sydney office can offer first-hand assistance to students studying in local institutions, including airport pickup services, helping arrange homestays and even opening bank accounts. We also stay in regular contact with our
            students and liaise with schools and parents in monitoring students' progress. For students choosing to study in other parts of Australia or overseas, we ensure that we only work with education providers that can offer a high
            standard of academic achievement and student support, and we would maintain regular contact with our students.
